Traffic congestion remains a pressing issue in modern urban environments, significantly impacting daily
life, public safety, and economic productivity. With recent advancements in data analytics and machine
learning, traffic prediction has emerged as a key solution to enhance mobility and reduce congestion. By
leveraging historical trends and real-time data, traffic prediction can optimize routing, improve user
convenience, and inform infrastructure development.
However, existing platforms like Google and Apple Maps often fail to deliver the precision required in
countries like India, where diverse and dynamic traffic conditions prevail.
Traffic Pattern Recognition and Prediction in India (TPRPI), a system designed to predict future
traffic patterns with a minimum accuracy of 93%. TPRPI utilizes historical data and real-time insights to
provide actionable predictions tailored to Indian roadways.
In this project, the main focus is on creating a foundational predictive model, excluding complex factors like
weather, events, and socio-economic trends for now, to streamline computational feasibility. Future
iterations will expand on these capabilities, integrating broader datasets and advanced algorithms. TPRPI
seeks to bridge existing gaps and align with recent trends in predictive analytics, offering an innovative
approach to traffic management tailored to India's unique challenges.
Google collab was used to run this base-code.
